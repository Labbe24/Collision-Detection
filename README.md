# Introduction 
This repository contains the development of a platform for simulation of robots and collision detection of colloaborating robots. 

# Why
Simulation is a powerfoll tool in the context of robotics. It is the aim of this project to build a platform capable of simulating different kinds of botos and perform collision detection between collaborating robots.

# How
Two primary tools are being used to accomplish this goal. 
1. Unity
2. URSim

# Build and Test
TODO: Requirements.
## Unity

## ROS

## URSim
